- 👋 Hi, I’m @BlakeEdwards
- 👀 I love techknowledgy and the posiabilities for the future. I'm interested in programming 
    for change and making a difference
- 🌱 I've finished a Tafe diploma for programming and currently about to finish my bachelor of 
    computer science(2021). Currently I am learning c++, while I did study c++ during my degree
    I still feel there is alot to explore. Api's libaries and dependencies will be of Importance
    to get a firm grip of the language and making me more diverse and applicable to the working force
    
    In the future I want to learn more into java react-native and nodeJs for web development. There
    is such a wide range of fields, technologies and industries to branch into
